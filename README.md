# PillPal

PillPal was initially inspired by Henry's father, a not so tech-savvy man with a dubious memory who has been a long-time culprit of fumbling his scheduled medication consumption. However, not long into the planning process, our team decided that PillPal could and should cater to a much broader range of Australians in the healthcare sector.

PillPal is a software designed to help nurses, age-care workers, and other carers to alleviate some of their stress within their high-pressure working environment. It does this by providing daily reminders of what drugs needs to be administered to which patients at what times. When reminders are overdue without having been checked off, PillPal will send the user a notification on their phone, reminding them to administer the drug.

As not all users are tech-savvy and many caretakers work in a fast-paced environment, we endeavoured to make the interface clean and intuitive. We employed strategic choices within our html, CSS, and Javascript to achieve our desired front-end. For the back-end, we used indexedDB to store patient and drug data locally, protecting caretakers and their patients from network outages.
