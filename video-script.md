## Introduction
PillPal is a web application designed to help nurses, age-care workers and other
caretakers keep track of when they need to administer medicine to their patients.
We believe our concept could make a meaningful impact on the global healthcare industry
as a whole. For instance, hospital nurses are subject to extreme work-loads and
are often understaffed. We hope to alleviate some of their stress by remembering
their drug duties for them, and sending a reminder in case they forget. Here is
an example of how PillPal could work in a real-life scenario with a pharmacologist,
a nurse and two patients.

## Scene 1
Nurse = N
Pharmacologist = P

_N and P are talking at table, facing across from each other_

**Camera looks over N's shoulder at his PC**

P: So you've got 2 new patients today.

N: Yep.

P: Have you got the doctor's notes?

N: Yeah, but I can't read them.

_N opens unintelligible notes on screen_

P: That's ok, I'll translate them for you. The first one is called Joe Biden. He needs 5mg of Donepezil once a day for his dementia.

N: What time?

P: 7am.

_N types details into PC_

N: Got it.

P: The second patient is Kaiyuan Qian. He needs cefalexin 3 times a day at 8am, 4pm, and 11pm.
   Make sure you are on time as we need to maintain the drug's bioavailability.

N: Yep.

_N types details into PC_

_End scene_

## Scene 2
Nurse = N Joe = J

**Time is 7am**

_N looks at laptop, sees reminder to give J his medicine._

N: Gotta give Joe his meds.

_N clicks on the reminder to minimise it. He then gets up and walks into adjacent room._

N: Good morning Joe.

_J is sleeping but snaps awake_

J: Oh good evening!

N: Here are your meds.

_N gives the meds to Joe, who takes them_

J: Thanks.

_N turns away, camera follows._

N: Oh also, make sure you - 

_N and camera turn back to look at J. He is sleeping again._

_End scene_

## Scene 3
Nurse = N Kaiyuan = K

**Time is 4:40pm**

_N is playing chess on his PC. He gets a notification on his phone. He looks._

**Camera looks at notification**

N: Oh shit!

_N quickly get the meds and rushed into adjacent room_

N: Here is your medication, sorry I'm late, we're really busy at the moment. I've
   come straight from seeing 5 other patients.

K: No worries.

_K takes medicine_

_End scene_
