_N and P are talking at table, facing across from each other_

**Camera looks over N's shoulder at his PC**

P: So you've got 2 new patients today.

N: Yep.

P: Have you got the doctor's notes?

N: Yeah, but they're unintelligible.

_N opens unintelligible notes on screen_

P: That's ok, I'll translate them for you. The first one is called Joe Biden. He needs 5mL of Donepezil once a day for his dementia.

N: What time?

P: 7am.

_N types details into PC_

N: Got it.

P: The second patient is Henry Fielding. He needs cefalexin 3 times a day at 8am, 4pm, and 12am.
   Make sure you are on time as we need to maintain the drug's bioavailability.
